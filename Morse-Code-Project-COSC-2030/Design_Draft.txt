This project will be an abstract data type that will take an input file,
ask the user if the file is either written in morse or plain english, and
then create an output file of the opposite of the file's langauage.

All of the pseudocode for this assignment can be viewed in the pseudocode.txt
file that will accompany this one.

The program will be written in C++, and utilize existing files to build it's 
own two binary search trees of morse and english respectively, for conversion
between the two. By building the tree in real-time, this program will be able
to add more symbols to the morse/english chart without much trouble to the user.

Requirements for the english-morse table is that the file must be formatted as
"english_char morse" in order to be loaded correctly into the linked list.

This means the morse code key can be extended to include symbols from other languages
and even emojis by the user, and can encode such things into morse. This will
be especially useful to the user, as being able to easily and quickly modify
the length and existence of the language will allow for any changes they wish
without programmer modification.
